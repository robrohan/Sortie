#
# USAGE:
#
# This script removes NatrualDoc, single line comments, and whitespace from javascript files
# (excluding unix type newlines - makes DOS newlines unix newlines).
#
# The script, however, it is a bit raw and you must follow some rules to have the comments 
# and whitespace come out correctly. Any top level comments must be the /* form with [space]* 
# at the start of the line for every line (see example below). If you want the comment to 
# appear in the documenation use /** otherwise use /*.  
# For example:
#
# /*
#  * non-api
#  */
# var wont_show = true;
#
# /**
#  * Function: willShow()
#  */
# function willShow(){...}
#
# Within a function or method only // comments can be used and they must not start at 
# the begining of a line.
# for example:
#
# function willShow() 
# {	
# 		//this kind of comment is ok
#		var x=1;
# //this comment is not ok and will mess up your code
#		var z=2;		//this comment is ok
#
#		//this kind comment, again, is ok
#		if(x==1)	{
#			/* this will mess up your code don't use within the body of a function */
#			blarg = true	
#		}//this will mess the code up as well (special case)
# }
#
# While it may seem a bit limiting at first, it's better to have consistent comments, and the
# code size reduction is pretty significant.
