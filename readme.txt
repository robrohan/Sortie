Neuromancer is a set of javascript libraries that provide a common interface between 
browsers and allow for javascript remoting.

To use the libraries, unzip the the archive and put it into a web accessible 
directory and include them on your pages. See the demos and documentation for usage.

Directory breakdown:

cf			= has Coldfusion specific libraries (thin array)
doc			= when the Ant doc target is run this is where the output will be (safe to delete)
doc_working	= used when generating docs (safe to delete)
js			= the Neruomancer library tree - copy this folder to your server
test			= unit tests of sorts to make sure nothing gets broken when coding the libs
